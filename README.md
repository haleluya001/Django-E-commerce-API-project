# ðŸŽ“ Capstone Project: Enterprise E-commerce REST API Backend

## 1. Project Overview & Goal
This project implements a complete, headless backend for an enterprise-level e-commerce application. The core goal is to provide a highly scalable, secure, and maintainable RESTful API that can be consumed by multiple frontend clients (web, mobile, third-party services).

The API is built using the robust Django framework and the powerful Django REST Framework (DRF), ensuring rapid development and adherence to modern web standards.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Securely manage user accounts and access tokens.
- Provide comprehensive product catalog and inventory management endpoints.
- Handle stateful logic for shopping carts and transactional order processing.
